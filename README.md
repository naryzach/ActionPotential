# ActionPotential
This program models an Action Potential from Thamnophis based on the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Details are found in the thesis document.

## Programmer's note
To any true and good programmer that sees this, I understand that the organization of this code and this project is abysmal. As a programmer, it pains me too. Clarity and organization were set aside while the research was pushed forward. Many changes were made in rapid succession to coax the model in different directions; such is the folly of science.
